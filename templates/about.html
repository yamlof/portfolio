                Hi, my name is Edwin and I'm a computer science student at the University of Liverpool.
                My focus right now is to develop my skills in my interest such as programming and drawing
                (with a bit of 3d modelling in Blender). I dont have a more specialized path to follow in
                Computer Science but I plan to learn a bit of everything first :).
